# SRFM-UpDownSamp
In this work, we propose a deep learning model with up/ down sampling to super-resolution. Joining up-projection and down-projection blocks in cascaded form help preserve the mutual dependencies between the input low-resolution (LR) image and the high-resolution (HR) target label.
